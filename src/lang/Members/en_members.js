I've majored in Clothing(BA), Media Art(BA) and Communication(MA, ABD), and taught Science in the alternative education field for 5 years. I've been interested in media on the basis of implementation. I've come to know Arduino when I was undergraduate and majored in Media Art, from that moment I've wanted to learn programming. And then, while teaching science class, I took advantage of Arduino, Breadboards. I've thought that I wish I could implement a real service or product using programming languages, so I decided to start to learn programming.",
